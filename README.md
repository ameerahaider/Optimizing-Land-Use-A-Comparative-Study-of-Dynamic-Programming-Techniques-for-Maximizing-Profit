# Optimizing Land Use: A Comparative Study of Dynamic Programming Techniques for Maximizing Profit
This project is a comparative study of various dynamic programming techniques used to solve the "cutting land" problem. The goal of this problem is to maximize the profit obtained by cutting a piece of land into smaller pieces of fixed size and selling them at different rates.

The project includes four different implementations of the problem using different dynamic programming techniques:

1. Simple Top-Down Approach
2. Top-Down Approach with Memoization
3. Bottom-Up Approach
4. Bottom-Up Approach with Size Calculation

# Prerequisites
C++ compiler (e.g., g++)

Git

# Installation
Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/username/Optimizing-Land-Use.git

# Compile the C++ files:

g++ -o part1 part1.cpp

g++ -o part2 part2.cpp

g++ -o part3 part3.cpp

g++ -o part4 part4.cpp

# Usage
Run the C++ files:

./part1

./part2

./part3

./part4

# Instructions
1. Follow the prompts to enter the width and length of the land and the rates for each piece of land.
2. The program will output the maximum obtainable profit and the optimal sizes for cutting the land (for parts 3 and 4).
